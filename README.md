# Linear-Programming-Applications

## Introduction

This contains the code for the linear programming formulations of the popular real world problems:
- **Sudoku Solver**: A mixed integer programming algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.
- **Convex Hull**: Solve the problem of finding a polyhedron which a set of points in its interior & does not contain any of the another set of points using linear programming.
- **Largest Ball in a Polyhedron**: Find & plot the largest ball that can fit inside the given polyhedron using linear programming.
- **Jigsaw Puzzle**: A linear programming based solver that solves jigsaw puzzles. The reference papers used for this problem are also inside the repository.

## Running the code
